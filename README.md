Note: I worked with QR code and Barcode scanner a lot while I was working on my research project for almost 1.5 years. That time I used Zxing.

I was sure the there might be something new now and I read about Barcode API detection by Google (Mobile Vision API ).

Now they are part of ML KIT. 
The Mobile Vision API is now a part ofÂ ML Kit.
